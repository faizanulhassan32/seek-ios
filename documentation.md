## Search Tips and Best Practices

### For Best Results:

1. **Be Specific**
   - Use full names when possible (e.g., "John Smith Software Engineer San Francisco" instead of just "John Smith")
   - Include context like location, company, or profession

2. **Try Different Formats**
   - If a name search doesn't work well, try:
     - Their email address
     - Social media username (with @)
     - Company name + person's name
     - Location + person's name

3. **Social Media Handles**
   - Starting your search with @ (e.g., "@username") will prioritize social media searches
   - The app will automatically search Instagram and Twitter for that handle

4. **Understanding Results**
   - Not all sections will have data for every person
   - Empty sections mean no public information was found
   - Social profiles show "Not Verified" unless officially verified on the platform

### What to Expect:

- **Public Figures**: More comprehensive results with extensive social media presence and mentions
- **Private Individuals**: Limited results, typically basic information and social profiles only
- **Common Names**: May return aggregated information from multiple sources; verify identity through photos and details
- **Unique Names**: Usually more accurate and complete results

## Understanding the Data

### Data Sources

The app aggregates information from:
1. **Web Search**: Public websites, news articles, and online directories

### Data Accuracy

### Privacy and Ethics

- The app only accesses publicly available information
